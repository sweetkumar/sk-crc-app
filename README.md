# CRC-Web-App
This repository is for the development of the final year project on the CRC Dept. of Invertis Univeristy.
 
 # Project Title
Web Application for the CRC Department, Invertis University.
 
 # Project Description 
The Corporate Resource Center (CRC) of the Invertis University has nearly been doing  all the work manually. For instance  - collecting resumes over email from the placement-opted students,  which more often than not becomes cumbersome to handle and eventually get lost. We intend to do away with this by developing a web application using the modern day technologies that can be used systematically and effectively by not only the CRC Deptâ€™s executives, but also by the students and the companies for the placement related activities and any workshop/seminar.
